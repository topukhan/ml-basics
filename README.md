# Simple Linear Regression Starter 📈

This project demonstrates the initial, untrained state of a simple linear regression model using Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib. (Creating own Model)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You need **Python 3** and the libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository** (or create the files locally):
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/topukhan/ml-basics.git
    cd ml-basics
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies** using the requirements file:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## 🛠️ Project Structure

| File | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`main.py`** | Contains all the logic: generating fake data, defining the model ($\hat{y} = wx + b$), initializing random parameters, and plotting the results. |
| **`requirements.txt`** | Lists the required Python packages and their version constraints. |
| **`.gitignore`** | Specifies files and folders (like virtual environments) that should be ignored by Git. |

## ✨ Running the Code

Execute the main script:

```bash
python main.py
